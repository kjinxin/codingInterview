Students may decide to take different "tracks" or sequences of courses in the Computer Science curriculum
. There may be more than one track that includes the same course, but each student follows a single linear
track from a "root" node to a "leaf" node. In the graph below, their path always moves left to right.
Write a function that takes a list of (source, destination) pairs, and returns the name of all of the
courses that the students could be taking when they are halfway through their track of courses.
